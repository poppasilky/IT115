# What is the Best Version Control System for My Project and Why?

## Version Control

Version Control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.  It is a fundamental tool for modern collaborative work.

## Version Control Systems

Version control systems have evolved through three main types. It began with [Local systems](https://www.gnu.org/software/rcs/), which worked on a single computer but offered no collaboration. To solve this, [Centralized systems](https://svn.example.com/repos) used a single server as the [source of truth](https://www.perforce.com/blog/vcs/single-source-of-truth-examples-ssot) but this created a risk if that server failed. Modern development is dominated by Distributed systems like [Git](https://github.com), where every developer has a full copy of the entire project history.
